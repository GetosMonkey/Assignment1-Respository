### 5th March 2025

Today my friend, marks the day I am officially attempting to create this project. I have big ideas, very big ideas but alas I already know they will not come to fruition because I'm bums at this course.

**remember  to follow the sequence:** write > git add > git commit > git push (optionally pull)

Today I'm going to try to finish the array implementation of my project as well as the reading in of my textfile into a database, but I'm going to test all of this on a smaller test textfile so that I don't waste too much of my computers memory for no good reason.
